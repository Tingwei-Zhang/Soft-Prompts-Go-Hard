It's monaural and feels flimsy. Unfortunately, you can't just plug your own headset into the Xbox One gamepad like you can the included headset, and without Bluetooth you can't use a wireless headset easily.\nDoc #2: Notes. 1  Headsets can only be connected to the Xbox One Wireless Controller.

I believe you need to rip out the power cord to accomplish that.
